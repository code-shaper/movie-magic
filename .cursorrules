You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI,
Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading,
  hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component directories and files (e.g.,
  components/AppHeader/AppHeader.tsx).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple
  statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server
  Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
